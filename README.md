just a basic system to handle form submissions.
​Live Site: https://form-approval-system.netlify.app/
​💡 The Goal
​Let people submit forms (like leave requests) and let an admin approve or reject them easily.
​⚙️ What's Inside?
​Frontend: Plain old HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS. Bootstrap for the looks. Deployed on Netlify.
​Backend: Node.js (Express) server that handles the APIs. Deployed on Render (so sometimes the first load is slow, sorry!).
​Database: MongoDB Atlas (cloud database).
